# EmotiKLUE #

## Introduction ##

EmotiKLUE is a submission to the [WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion Shared
Task](http://implicitemotions.wassa2018.com/). The aim of the shared
task is to predict one of six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise) from the context of masked emotion words as in the
following example:

> My dad was [#TRIGGERWORD#] that I washed his car so he gave me money
> to buy snacks üò¢

EmotiKLUE tackles this task by learning independent representations of
the left and right contexts of the masked emotion word and by
combining those representations with an LDA topic model.

The system is described and evaluated in greater detail in Proisl et
al. (2018).


## Usage ##

For information on how to train, retrain or test a model or on how to
use it for prediction, see the help messages of the corresponding
subcommands:
